## What’s implemented

- Two text inputs: email and password.
- A “Login” button.
- On submit:
  Either mock a login (accept any non-empty email/password).
- Display a list of random data
- Fetched from a public API
- swipe to refresh

## Bonus Points

- TypeScript usage.
- Nice basic UI (using libraries like React Native Paper, Native Base, or just StyleSheet).

## Known issues:

- If refresh the page on account page, you wiil be redirected to login page.

## A few sentences on what you would improve if you had more time.

- Real Google Sign-In flow using Firebase Auth or Google OAuth2.
- Fix the account behavior page after refreshing the page.
